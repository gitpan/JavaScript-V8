* Use Alien::V8 in the build process if we can't find V8 via Devel::CheckLib
  Mostly so we get the benefit of cpantesters testing JavaScript::V8
  for us, but also make it so that people don't have to install V8
  manually...
* Lots of tests
* Look at JavaScript::V8x::TestMoreish on CPAN
  It might be interesting to investigate (and also check the recent changes haven't broken it...)
* re::engine::V8
  Okay, slightly out there, but V8's irregexp is fast and I've already
  written re::engine::RE2, so it seems like I should complete the
  set...
