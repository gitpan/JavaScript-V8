=head1 NAME

JavaScript::V8 - Perl interface to the V8 JavaScript engine

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use JavaScript::V8;

  my $context = JavaScript::V8::Context->new();

  $context->bind_function(write => sub { print @_ });

  $context->eval(q/
    for (i = 99; i > 0; i--) {
        write(i + " bottle(s) of beer on the wall, " + i + " bottle(s) of beer\n");
        write("Take 1 down, pass it around, ");
        if (i > 1) {
            write((i - 1) + " bottle(s) of beer on the wall.");
        }

            write("No more bottles of beer on the wall!");
        }
    }
  /);

=head1 INSTALLING V8

=head2 From Source

See L<V8 issue 413|http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=413> if you are
having trouble on gcc 4.4.1.

    svn checkout http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ v8
    cd v8
    scons library=shared
    sudo mv include/v8.h /usr/local/include/
    sudo mv libv8.so /usr/local/lib/

If you're using a 64-bit architecture, you need to include C<arch=x64> when
running scons:

    scons library=shared arch=x64

Otherwise, perl will complain when trying to link/load v8. For more
information, see L<V8 issue
330|http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=330>.

=head3 On OS X

On OS X I've successfully used L<Homebrew|http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>,
install Homebrew then:

  brew install v8

=head2 Binary

=head3 Linux

On Ubuntu 10.04 (and possibly Debian), the library and header files can be installed by running:

    sudo aptitude install libv8-2.0.3 libv8-dev

Similar packages may be available for other distributions (adjust the package names accordingly).
